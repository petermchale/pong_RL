# Playing Pong using Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a hot field right now, with exciting applications in robotics and self-driving cars. I present a rigorous mathematical derivation of a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to beat a computer at Pong. 
The algorithm uses a neural network to model the function that maps observations into actions. 
The algorithm is coded in Python. 

A full description is contained in `analysis.ipynb`. This notebook contains a video that doesn't render in GitHub but does in nbviewer: see [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petermchale/pong_RL/blob/master/analysis.ipynb).
