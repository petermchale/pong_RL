# Playing Pong using Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a hot field right now, with exciting applications in robotics and self-driving cars. 
I present a rigorous mathematical derivation of a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to beat a computer at Pong. 
This AI does not rely on hand-engineered rules or features; 
instead, it masters the environment by looking at raw pixels and learning from experience, just as humans do.
A full description is contained in the Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb`.
